# Word Guesser

This Discord bot allows users to play a word guessing game within their Discord server. The bot randomly selects a word from various categories, and players can guess letters or the entire word to uncover the hidden word. The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses and keeps track of the number of attempts left. Players can start, stop, and get help with commands

### Commands
* `!help` or `/help` : Displays instructions on how to play the game.
* `!start` or `/start`: Starts a new word guessing game.
* `!stop` or `/stop` : Stops the ongoing word guessing game.
* `!letter [letter]` or `/letter [letter]` : Guesses a letter in the word.
* `!guess [word]` or `/guess [word]` : Guesses the entire word.
